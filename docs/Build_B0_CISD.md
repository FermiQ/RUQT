# `Build_B0_CISD.f90`

## Overview

This Fortran subroutine, `Build_B0_CISD`, calculates the B0 coefficient for Configuration Interaction Singles and Doubles (CISD) energy calculations. This coefficient is a component in quantum chemistry computations, likely used to correct or normalize energy values.

## Key Components

- **`subroutine Build_B0_CISD(...)`**: The main subroutine that performs the B0 coefficient calculation.
    - **Arguments**:
        - `cisd_b0`: Output variable to store the calculated B0 coefficient (real*8).
        - `norb`: Total number of orbitals (integer).
        - `numfcore`: Number of frozen core orbitals (integer).
        - `numfvirt`: Number of frozen virtual orbitals (integer).
        - `numocc`: Number of occupied orbitals (integer).
        - `numvirt`: Number of virtual orbitals (integer).
        - `B1data`: Input data of type B1 (custom type, likely containing single excitation amplitudes).
        - `B2data`: Input data of type B2 (custom type, likely containing double excitation amplitudes).
    - **Logic**:
        1. Initializes `sum_B0_1` and `sum_B0_2` to 0.
        2. Calculates `sum_B0_1` by summing the squares of elements from `B1data%a%o`. This loop iterates over specified ranges of occupied and virtual orbitals.
        3. Calculates `sum_B0_2` by summing the squares of elements from `B2data%ab%m` and `B2data%aa%m`. This involves nested loops over occupied and virtual orbitals, with a conditional check for `k.ne.j.and.a.ne.b` for the `aa` term.
        4. Computes the final `cisd_b0` as `1 + sum_B0_1 + sum_B0_2`.
        5. Prints the final `cisd_b0` value.

## Important Variables/Constants

- **`cisd_b0` (real*8)**: The output B0 coefficient.
- **`B1data` (type B1)**: Contains data related to single excitations (e.g., `B1data%a%o(b,k)`).
- **`B2data` (type B2)**: Contains data related to double excitations (e.g., `B2data%ab%m(a,k)%n(b,j)`, `B2data%aa%m(a,k)%n(b,j)`).
- **Loop indices and counters (integer)**: `i, j, k, a, b, p, q, r, s, t, x, y, z, iter, norb, numfcore, numfvirt, numocc, numvirt, size_l, size_lc, size_c, size_lcr, energy_values, numatomic`. These define orbital ranges and iteration counts.
- **`sum_B0_1`, `sum_B0_2` (real*8)**: Intermediate sums used in the B0 calculation.

## Usage Examples

This subroutine is likely called from within a larger quantum chemistry package when CISD calculations are performed.

```fortran
! Assuming B1data and B2data are populated, and orbital parameters are defined
call Build_B0_CISD(my_b0_coeff, total_orbitals, frozen_core_orbitals, frozen_virtual_orbitals, occupied_orbitals, virtual_orbitals, singles_data, doubles_data)
! my_b0_coeff will now hold the calculated B0 value
```

## Dependencies and Interactions

- **`TypeMod`**: This module is used, presumably defining the custom types `B1` and `B2`.
- **`FunctionMod`**: This module is used, though no explicit functions from it appear to be called directly within this subroutine. It might be used by underlying functions or data types.
- The subroutine reads from `B1data` and `B2data` structures.
- The calculation depends on parameters defining the orbital space (`norb`, `numfcore`, `numfvirt`, `numocc`, `numvirt`).
- It outputs the calculated `cisd_b0` value and prints it to standard output.
